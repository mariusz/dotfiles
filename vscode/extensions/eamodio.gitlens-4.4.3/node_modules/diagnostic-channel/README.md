# Node Diagnostic-Channel

This package is intended to connect event 'publishers' to event 'subscribers' in such a way that the 'context' of the event is preserved. The exact nature of 'context' is deliberately left unspecified.

## Example Usage

### Subscriber

Subscribing to an event is simple:

```js
var channel = require('diagnostic-channel');

channel.subscribe('someEvent', function (event) {
    // do something about the event
});
```

The contents of the `event` parameter to the subscribe callback is determined entirely by the publisher.

### Publisher

Publishing an event can be simple:

```js
var channel = require('diagnostic-channel');

channel.publish('someEvent', someData);
```

In many cases, preserving context may require some additional effort:

```js
var channel = require('diagnostic-channel');

function doWork(args, callback) {
    // In some context...
    doBatchedAsyncWork(args, channel.bindToContext((result) => {
        channel.publish('someEvent', {result: result});
        callback(result);
    }))
}
```

## API

### Subscribe

`channel.subscribe(name: string, callback: (event: any) => void): void`

Register the callback to be called when `publish` is invoked with a matching name. The callback will be given the data that is passed to the `publish` call.

If the callback throws an error, it will be silently ignored. If the callback modifies the event object, any subsequent subscribers will see the modified object, and it may also impact the original code's execution.

### Publish

`channel.publish(name: string, event: any): void`

Trigger each subscribed callback for the same named event, passing the event object to each.

Subscribers may modify the event object.

### Unsubscribe

`channel.unsubscribe(name: string, callback: (event: any) => void): void`

Remove a previously registered callback from the named event. This uses function equality so it must be a reference to the same function, not an equivalent function.

### addContextPreservation

`channel.addContextPreservation(preserver: (callback: Function) => Function)`

Pushes the provided context preservation function onto a 'stack' of functions to preserve context.

The context preservation function `preserver` should track the context at the time it is invoked, and return a function that restores the preserved context, forwards its arguments to `callback`, returns the context to before this function was called, then returns the result of `callback`.

A simple example preserving the Zone.js context:

```js
channel.addContextPreservation((callback) => {
    return Zone.current.wrap(callback);
});
```

For a more general contrived example, where the 'context' is a global object called `context`:

```js
var context = { value: 1 };

channel.addContextPreservation((callback) => {
    var preservedContext = context;
    return function () {
        var priorContext = context;
        context = preservedContext;
        var result = callback.apply(this, arguments);
        context = priorContext;
        return result;
    }
});
```

### bindToContext

`channel.bindToContext(callback: Function)`

Returns a function which will call the callback after applying each of the registered context preservation functions, and return the result of the callback after unwinding each of the context preservation functions.

For example, when using Zone.js:

```js
channel.addContextPreservation((callback) => Zone.current.wrap(callback));

var z1 = Zone.current.fork({name: 'zone 1'});
var z2 = Zone.current.fork({name: 'zone 2'});

var z1BoundFunc = z1.run(() => channel.bindToContext(() => Zone.current.name));

var result = z2.run(() => z1BoundFunc());
```

Because the function was bound in `zone 1`, `result` will be `zone 1`.

### registerMonkeyPatch

`channel.registerMonkeyPatch(packageName: string, patcher: {versionSpecifier: string, patch: (any, path: string) => any})`;

In order to inject publishing and context preservation behavior into third party libraries, we support monkey patching libraries as they are `require`'d.

Calling this function will register a candidate monkey patcher to be applied when a future `require(packageName)` is called. If the package's version is a semver match for the `versionSpecifier` range, then the original object for that package is passed to the `patch` function, along with the path to the module, and the `patch` function should return a patched version which will end up as the result of the `require`.

For a simple example where we patch a `doSomethingAsync` method of the `foo` module to preserve the current context when invoking a callback:

```js
function patchFunction(originalPackage, packagePath) {
    var originalFooAsync = foo.doSomethingAsync;
    foo.doSomethingAsync = function () {
        var callback = arguments[arguments.length-1];
        if (callback && typeof callback == 'function') {
            arguments[arguments.length-1] = channel.bindToContext(callback);
        }
        return originalFooAsync.apply(this, arguments);
    }
    return originalPackage;
}

var patcher = {
    versionSpecifier: ">= 1.0.0 < 2.0.0",
    patch: patchFunction
};

channel.registerMonkeyPatch('foo', patcher);

var foo = require('foo');
// Now foo.doSomethingAsync will be the patched version, assuming that the version of the foo package found by require() falls within the 1.0.0 - 2.0.0 range.
```

### autoLoadPackages

`channel.autoLoadPackages(projectRoot: string)`

Attempt to automatically discover and `require()` any publisher or subscriber packages present in the project.

Specifically, inspect every package in the `dependencies` of `projectRoot/package.json` and see whether they have a `pubsubAutoLoad` key set to a truthy value in their own package.json

This is so you do not need to explcitly
```js
require('mongodb-pub'); require('mongodb-sub'); require('redis-pub'); require('redis-sub');
// ...
``` 

in your code, you just need to specify them in the package.json so they are installed, and then invoke this function.
