# Advanced New File - Visual Studio Code Extension

Making the creation of a new file even easier. Specify the name of the file on creation and if you define a path that doesn't exist yet the folders will be created.
Before using the extension please make sure to read the [Disclaimer](#Disclaimer).

> Inspired by [Scott Kuroda]()'s [AdvancedNewFile](https://github.com/skuroda/Sublime-AdvancedNewFile) for Sublime.

# How to use

![demo](https://github.com/dkundel/vscode-new-file/raw/master/images/demo.gif)

1. a) Press the Shortcut <kbd>Cmd+Alt+N</kbd> or run the `Files: Advanced New File` command.
1. b) Right click in the explorer menu and choose 'Advanced New File'.

2. Enter a relative file path or stick with the default. If you have a file open it will guess the extension based on the current extension.

3. An empty file will be created and the cursor will be placed into the new file.

4. Happy Coding! :)  

# Configuration

You can configure the default behavior through various settings in your `settings.json`:

```js
{
  "newFile.defaultBaseFileName": "newFile",
  "newFile.relativeTo": "file", // "root" or "project"
  "newFile.defaultFileExtension": ".ts",
  "newFile.rootDirectory": "~",
  "newFile.showPathRelativeTo": "root", // "project" or "none"
  "newFile.expandBraces": false // setting to true will allow for creating multiple files such as `new-folder/{file1,file2}.js`
}
```

You can also set a new keyboard shortcut for the command in `keybindings.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "cmd+n",
    "command": "newFile.createNewFile"
  }
]
```

files on your hard drive and if necessary create the respective folder structure.
