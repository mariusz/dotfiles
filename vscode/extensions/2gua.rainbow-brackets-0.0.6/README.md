# Rainbow Brackets for Visual Studio Code

Provide rainbow colors for the round brackets, the square brackets and the squiggly brackets. This is particularly useful for Lisp or Clojure programmers, and of course, JavaScript, and other programmers.

The isolated right bracket will be highlighted in red.
